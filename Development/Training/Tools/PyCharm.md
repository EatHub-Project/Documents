PyCharm is an advanced Python multi-platform IDE created by JetBrains, with powerful code assistance, automated refactoring, rich navigation, integrated debugger, native VCS integration, and more.

There is a Free Community Edition, available under Apache 2 license. There is also a Professional Edition which supports multi-language and web development frameworks like Django.

## Download
We are going to use the **Professional Edition** because of Python Support. It has ha 30-day free trial period, after which you need a license. The team will be using the trial while we get in touch with the teachers in order to adquire a free student license.
