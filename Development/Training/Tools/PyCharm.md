There is a Free Community Edition, available under Apache 2 license. There is also a Professional Edition which supports multi-language and web development frameworks like Django.

#### What I personally love about PyCharm (Rafa VÃ¡zquez)
In my opinion as Develper Lead, the best features of PyCharm are the code completion, the amazing code refactoring, and the debugger with step-by-step capabilities. PyCharm has these features in common with IntelliJ (for Java), wich I use and love a lot for my daily Android development.
