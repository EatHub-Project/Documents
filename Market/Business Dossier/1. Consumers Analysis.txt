Consumers’ main profile is: amateur cooks (only a few are professionals), male or female, between 30 and 50 years old. 
Consumers’ first need is to share recipes and pictures of theirs results. Nevertheless, in websites where consumers are allowed to interact, they have a tendency to make groups to share different kind of interests related or not with the gastronomy.
They also show the need to contact between them, so they flood their users’ pages with message providing email addresses or facebook in order to stay in touch (this is more frequent in over forties users).
