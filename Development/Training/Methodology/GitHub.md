# GitHub

In this document we explain how and why we are using GitHub in our development process. The information given here is very brief because most parts are explained in more detail in other documents.

## Branches

We manage branches acording to "Git-Flow", then we will use two branches: development and master. Development is a default branch where we are developing. And master, is a branch for estable version in the end of each spint.

Each member, when he want to upload his task, will use a "feature" branch. When that task is ended the member must do "pull request" from "feature" branch to development branch. 

Finally, the pull requests are manage by Leader Development. He acept or decline the pull request.
