#Scrum

In this document we will give a breaf introduction to Scrum and how the process works. We are also explaining the way we are applying it to our development as a simple step-by-step guide for reference.

## What is Scrum

Scrum is a software development methodology, within Agile software development, concretely incremental and iterative development.

#### Roles in Scrum

There are three main roles:

1. Producto Owner: represents the stakeholders and is the voice of the customer.
2. Development Team: is responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments of product at the end of each Sprint (the Sprint Goal).
3. Scrum Master: is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.

Finally, Product Owner, Development Team and Scrum Master make the Scrum Team.

#### Meetings

#### Sprint

Sprint, or iteration, is the unit of development in Scrum, I mean a temporal effort. And the typical duration is two weeks.

Each Sprint is starting by a planning meeting where the tasks are identied and estimated. In the end of Sprint there is another meeting named "review-and-retrospective" where the progress is reviewed.

Acording to wikipedia (en): "Scrum emphasizes working product at the end of the Sprint that is really "done"; in the case of software, this means a system that is integrated, fully tested, end-user documented, and potentially shippable."

#### Documents

1. Producto Backlog: acording to wikipedia (en) "is an ordered list of requirements that is maintained for a product."
2. Sprint Backlog:
3. Increment:
